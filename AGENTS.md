# Workspace guidance

## Start here

Read `README.md`, then `docs/ARM_SESSION_HANDOFF.md` for current arm status and
the next session. Use `docs/ARM_LAYER_TODOS.md` and the owning package's `TODO.md`
for open work; remove completed tasks instead of appending incident histories.
Operator procedures belong in `docs/ARM_RIG_TEST.md`; architecture and ownership
are in `docs/ARM_BASE_LAYER.md` and `docs/SOURCE_LAYOUT.md`.

As of 2026-11-10, the operator verified manual movement of all five active
motors A2–A6. A1 is omitted from the current rig profile. Next: the operator
builds a base that permits A1 rotation. Follow `docs/ARM_POSE_TEST.md` for
reference capture, model-pose replay, adjustment and staged speed trials.
The supported baseline remains 5 deg/s; all active A2–A6 measured-speed
trips are 1.5 rad/s. Calibration, loaded holding and current protection remain
unqualified. Do not promote production confirmation flags from this motion check.

## Source and verification

- ENCOS is chassis: C11 driver/utilities in `src/encos_driver/`; shared Python
  APIs in `src/motors/`. Damiao is arm: DM-MC02 firmware in
  `src/damiao_firmware/`. Native Ubuntu 24.04 is the deployment target.
- Shared launch/config belongs in `src/bringup/`; reusable code belongs in the
  owning package; `scripts/` contains thin wrappers/build helpers. Follow
  `docs/SOURCE_LAYOUT.md`; do not add root-level implementations.
- Run the relevant checks in `tests/README.md`. Distinguish fake-motor, ROS/PTY,
  model and physical evidence. Generated reports/builds/logs stay ignored.
- Keep vendor contents unchanged. Use references indexed by `vendor/encos/README.md`
  when available; do not scan/extract `vendor/encos/_archive/` unless requested
  for the corresponding Windows, USB-CAN, bridge, IgH, demo/video or CAD work.
- ENCOS hardware context: `docs/ENCOS_WORKSPACE.md`, `docs/ENCOS_BRINGUP.md`,
  `docs/ENCOS_TEST_BENCH.md`, `docs/ROS2_MOTOR_CONTROL_STATUS.md`.

## Motor contracts

- One serial owner per controller and one radio reader. Telemetry consumes
  cached feedback; never add CAN register polling while enabled or let a
  telemetry read renew a motion lease. Preserve raw-shaft SI units and freshness.
- Preserve latched faults and explicit recovery. Keyboard **R** saves evidence,
  verifies disabled/stationary motors and recovers through the existing owner;
  success stays disarmed until fresh **E + arrow**. Never auto-reset/re-enable.
- Current rig: A2–A6 on CAN2, original IDs 2–6 and feedback IDs 18–22; A1's
  inventory route is CAN1/ID1/feedback17. Subsets retain physical slot numbers
  and never silently omit another missing motor. See `docs/ARM_MOTOR_IDS.md`.
- Manual travel removes startup-angle windows only when explicitly selected.
  Release disables torque; nonselected joints stay disabled. Mechanical support
  must carry all links on torque loss. This adapter is not gravity holding.
- Session zero, raw encoder position, model zero and calibrated physical limits
  are distinct. Keep unknown calibration null and production flags false until
  their documented acceptance criteria are measured.
- Pocket policy and commissioning live in `docs/POCKET_ARM_CONTROL.md`. Preserve
  original input deadlines, SE priming, diagonal stop/resume and cancellation
  during enable. Its GUI consumes cached telemetry and requests stop; it must
  not acquire another motor/radio owner or publish competing `/cmd_vel`.

## Modeling

Read `docs/ONSHAPE_ARM_PREVIEW.md` before model edits. MuJoCo model and rendering code lives in
`src/simulation/simulation/`, coordinated motion in `src/controls/controls/`,
and shared assets in `src/robot_description/mujoco/`.
Preserve D3 closure and the 150 mm connection-center spacing; keep simulation
coordinates separate from hardware calibration. Run the relevant layout/model,
overview, color, magnetic, terrain and actuator checks. Never commit
`src/simulation/.env`, `src/robot_description/mujoco/config.json` or backups.
